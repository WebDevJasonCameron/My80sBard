# My 80's Bard

## Welcome

Have you every wanted to create a character that has an encyclopedic knowledge of 80's song lyrics? They can't help yell out "I'm B-B-bad to the B-B-bone" when another character asks them why they did some kind of dumb seductive action on another innocent maiden within the campaign? No? Well, this might not be the application for you. For all you other amazing writers and DnD players, welcome. This completely useless application is an homage to 80's rock hits, and my need to build an overly complicate tool for the purpose of bringing to life "My 80's Bard."

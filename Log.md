Yes I wrote this same day as the 24th. Why? Cause I'm establishing a setting! Every DM should build an environment that captures the imagination of his/her players. Is that what I'm doing here? No. Not really. I only wanted to set up a log file style expectations. See the dates and lines that look great? Yeah! That's what I want you to see between each log entry. Just be glad I didn't add time stamps between entries!

Created Project. I thought I needed to do this in IntelliJ. I am familiar with the program. It was something I used to update DB with Java. However, rather than repeating the project I did in school I decided to try to build this very ambitious web application using JS and other new tech I have yet completed. As such, this will probably take me some time to complete. I will talk about the goals and plans within the RM file. This log md file is simply notes I want to make along my progress. In other words, you'll want to come here to see the gritty ramblings of a developer as he tries to duck tap and glitter bomb his project into some kind of monstrosity. Happy reading and I hope you can get a little laugh from my struggles along the way. Lest's do this like Brutus!
